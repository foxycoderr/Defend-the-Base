# Defend the Base
- Mobs are moving on a field along a certain line
- Towers can be purchased using buttons on the side put on the field
- Each time a mob is killed, it drops money
- As soon as a mob enters the base, health drops
- Once the health is on zero, it is game over

### Types of mobs:
- Speedy lights - move very fast, very low hitpoints
- Mids - move mid, hitpoints mid
- Heavies - move very slowly, massive hitpoints
